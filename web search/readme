I wrote a driver to access (GET) a webpage, scan the response for first occurrence of a string (word/phrase), and set a boolean attribute if found.

The URL must be complete and exact including HTTP:// HTTPS:// (copy from browser address). The search string must be exact including case, spaces (copy from siteâ€™s webpage loaded in browser). Content created by webpage dynamic scripts will probably not be found by the driver. Create a virtual device from the driver to use in a tile.
